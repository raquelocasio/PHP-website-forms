# PHP-website-forms
A collection of website forms powered by PHP, originally created by ReusableForms.com

The forms use a mix of HTML, CSS, and/or Bootstrap, and the form handling is done with PHP.

The goal of this project is to provide useful website forms that are up-to-date with the latest most recent versions of the languages and libraries.

All contributions will be considered and are welcome.
